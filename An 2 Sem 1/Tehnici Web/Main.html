    Welcome to Training for Android developers. Here you'll find training classes that describe how to accomplish a specific task with code samples you can re-use in your app. Classes are organized into several groups you can see at the top-level of the left navigation.

    The first training guides below teach you the essentials for Android app development. If you're a new Android app developer, you should complete each of these classes in order.

    Various online video courses are also available if you'd prefer an interactive video experience.

    Most Android apps need to save data, even if only to save information about the app state during onPause() so the user's progress is not lost. Most non-trivial apps also need to save user settings, and some apps must manage large amounts of information in files and databases. This class introduces you to the principal data storage options in Android, including:

    Saving key-value pairs of simple data types in a shared preferences file
    Saving arbitrary files in Android's file system
    Using databases managed by SQLite

    Saving data to a database is ideal for repeating or structured data, such as contact information. This class assumes that you are familiar with SQL databases in general and helps you get started with SQLite databases on Android. The APIs you'll need to use a database on Android are available in the android.database.sqlite package
